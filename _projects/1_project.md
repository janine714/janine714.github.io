CaReAQA is a novel question-answering model that enables large language models to reason over auscultation audio. It tackles the complex task of interpreting real-world heart and lung sounds and generating diagnostic responses to open-ended clinical questions. Unlike traditional diagnostic classifiers or rule-based expert systems, CaReAQA is designed to handle free-form queries in a flexible and interpretable manner, closely mirroring human diagnostic reasoning.

We introduce a benchmark comprising real-world auscultation recordings paired with rich annotations and diverse question types. To enable reasoning over audio signals, we align audio representations with text through a shared latent space and generate answers using a language model conditioned on both audio and question embeddings.

Our model demonstrates strong performance across multiple tasks, including yes/no questions, symptom identification, and open-form diagnostic explanations, showcasing its potential for audio-based clinical decision support.
