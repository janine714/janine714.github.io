I am a PhD student at Eindhoven University of Technology. My research focuses on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and audio, with an emphasis on applications in healthcare. I am particularly interested in how multimodal systems can enhance the way we interact with and interpret medical information.

I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Language Technology from Uppsala University, where I developed a strong foundation in natural language processing and machine learning. My current work builds on that background by exploring intelligent systems that combine language and sound to support innovation in health. âœ¨ðŸ¤–ðŸ©º
